# Small Area Estimation Workshop for UPenn Sociology and Demography Quantitative Methodology Working Group - October 2023

The workshop will briefly introduce Bayesian models for small area estimation and describe an application to model tract-level mortality rates in Massachusetts. These methods are potentially useful in a variety of settings when researchers have to deal with complete but sparse data.

Slides for the workshop, which explain what each .Rmd file does, are in QMWG_Small_Area_Estimation_Workshop.pdf. The mortality data used for the workshop is a confidentialized version of restricted access data from the Boston Health Department.
